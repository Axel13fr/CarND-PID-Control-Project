# PID Control Project

Overview
---
This repository contains the code needed to build a program which connects to the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) and control the vehicle via a PID.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Optimize PID parameters to have the vehicle stay on track and drive as fast as possible safely 
* Summarize the results and document how parameters were tuned


## Tuning the PID Parameters

I approached this problem by going over 2 steps:
1. Tuning the PID manually until I had something where the vehicle could drive a full lap
2. Use an optimization algorithm (in my case twiddle) to come to a more finely optimized result 

### The effect of P, I and D parameters


### Manually tuning the parameters


### Finely optimizing with Twiddle
